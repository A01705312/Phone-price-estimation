# Phone-price-estimation
Welcome to one of the most rewarding projects I have ever done, in the sense it is one of the projects I have suffered the most doing, I'm really not good with coding :v
This project consists of making predictions, using regression, decision trees and clusters of the price range of mobile phones from back in the day using a dataset obtained from kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iabhishekofficial/mobile-price-classification?datasetId=11167&sortBy=voteCount). 
In order to run the program you only need the py of the code, and the dataset, all of these archives will be uploaded into this github. 
So with nothing else to say please enjoy :)
